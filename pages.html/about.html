        <h1>About</h1>

        <div class="paragraphBackground">
            <P class="paragraphStyle">Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by
                Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon in 2013 for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. The
                series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his good-hearted but
                fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures
                that take place across an infinite number of realities, often traveling to other planets and dimensions
                through portals and on Rick's flying saucer. The general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two
                conflicting scenarios: domestic family drama, and a misanthropic grandfather dragging his grandson into
                hijinks.</P>

                    dangerous and unpredictable adventures. In this first chapter, the protagonists go to another
                    dimension to look for seeds of 'mega-trees'. Meanwhile, Morty's parents (Jerry and Beth) argue about
                    the influence that the grandfather can have on the grandson.</p>

                    happens she won't have any more affairs with Morty. Rick and Summer throw a party, although Morty
                    doesn't think it's a good idea. Morty was right and the party will get out of hand.</p>
